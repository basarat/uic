UI Components for React with strong typing using TypeScript.

THIS IS NOT READY AT THE MOMENT. PLEASE MOVE ON.

# Why? 
I've had the luxury of working in excellent places with excellent teams unifying their frontend practices and patterns. Many colleagues have asked me to release the patterns as a seperate OSS library to share the learnings and uplift how the world does front end. So here it is ...

The objective is to share concepts (not just code). In fact the code should really be a *sample* of how the concepts work in practice to build a coherent UI experience.

# The process of building great frontend experiences

## Pattern: It starts with design
It starts with *design*. If you don't have design guides of what you are tryin to build (in code) then you are going to have a problem. 

Here lets leverage the excellent [material UI guide](https://material.io/guidelines/) provided by google


## Pattern: Now that you know where you are going, backtrack
Target big, and break down small tangible problems. Example: 
* You *this great looking page* (assume some great login page). 
* You need *this component* to build this page (assume some input field). 
* This component needs these other components to exist (assume *error display* or something else).
